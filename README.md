3D representation of the [d3v4 dependency tree](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9a8124ccde3a4e9625bc413b48f14b30).
Fixes each level of the tree to its own 2D plane to accent the hierarchy.

Uses [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) for the ThreeJS/WebGL rendering and [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) as the underlying force-directed engine, including node collision detection.
